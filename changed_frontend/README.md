This template offers a streamlined configuration to set up React with Vite, ensuring seamless integration with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and enforcing essential ESLint rules for code consistency.

Currently, the Vite ecosystem boasts two prominent official plugins tailored for React development:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)** leverages [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to facilitate Fast Refresh, enabling rapid updates to React components during development cycles.

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)** harnesses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, enhancing performance by utilizing a speedy JavaScript/TypeScript compiler. This plugin optimizes React applications for efficiency and responsiveness, making it an excellent choice for projects prioritizing performance alongside developer productivity.

These plugins collectively elevate the development experience with Vite, enabling React developers to build modern, responsive web applications efficiently while adhering to best practices in code quality and live updates management.

I've made significant strides in enhancing the Code Judge project across several key areas:

1. **Language Expansion:** Introducing Ruby, Golang, and prompt-based evaluations (Promptv1 and Promptv2) has bolstered the project's capability to handle a broader range of programming languages, ensuring inclusivity and versatility.

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** I've meticulously expanded the test suite to encompass a wide array of scenarios and edge cases. This thorough testing approach not only enhances reliability but also fortifies the project against potential pitfalls.

3. **Feature-Rich Frontend:** A well-crafted frontend interface, housed in its designated "frontend" folder, has been meticulously developed. This frontend empowers users with an intuitive platform to seamlessly compile and execute code across all supported languages, enhancing usability and accessibility.

4. **Custom Feature Integration:** In addition to foundational enhancements, I've introduced a bespoke feature aimed at augmenting the project's functionality. This addition reflects a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation in code evaluation capabilities.

These combined efforts underscore a holistic approach to improving the Code Judge project, equipping it with robust capabilities, rigorous testing standards, and a user-centric frontend experience.
